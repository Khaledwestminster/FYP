Hello, I am wondering if you can help me complete this project. This project was made using Cursor. It also has Django+poetry backend with a Vite+React frontend. Currently the database is working to store user data with a functioning login system, have a working navbar. There is a page dedicated for language courses that users can learn. When I press the 'Start Course' button nothing happens but I need it to direct users to the quizzes for them to learn the languages. this is the details of the feature; I want to implement the langauge quiz section for this. I want quizzes in Spanish, French, German and Italian in levels as Beginner, Intermediate and Expert. For Beginner, I want basic questions for asking how to say hello in the different languages, and give 3 different prompts with one being the correct answer e.g. Bonjour is hello in French but have prompts such as Arrivederci as the wrong answer in the France section. This project uses django _ poetry backend with a vite+react frontend. For Intermediate, I want to use a Text-to-Speech API that will have the website say the phrase to the user where the user will repeat until confident to move on to Expert. In Expert, I want you to do what you did in Beginner and Intermediate but with more advanced phrases.
Also, make it so that the user can save their progress in the database. Please also fix and improve upon the frontend as well.
